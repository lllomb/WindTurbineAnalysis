# WindTurbineAnalysis
__LSTM-based time series forecasting for wind turbine active power prediction:__  
This project involves predicting wind energy production using time series data from wind turbines. The approach leverages machine learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast energy production based on various weather and turbine-related features.

__Project Overview__:  
The goal of this project is to predict the active power generated by wind turbines, given input data such as wind speed, direction, temperature, and turbine-specific features. The model uses a supervised learning approach with a sliding window technique to process the time series data.

__Key Features__:  
- Data Preprocessing: Includes standardization of input features and targets, handling of missing values, and decomposition of wind speed into x and y components.
- Model: An LSTM-based deep learning model optimized using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visual comparison of predictions with actual values.

__Files Description__:

__3. requirements.txt__  
This file lists the required Python packages for this project. It includes dependencies like numpy, pandas, tensorflow, scikit-learn, optuna, and matplotlib.


__Data:__  
The dataset used in this project contains time series data from wind turbines, including the following features:
- Fecha (Timestamp): The timestamp of the data point.
- Potencia Activa (Active Power): The energy output of the wind turbine.
- Velocidad de Viento (Wind Speed): The speed of the wind.
- Direcci√≥n de Viento (Wind Direction): The direction of the wind.
- Temperatura Ambiente (Ambient Temperature): The ambient temperature at the turbine location.
- Frecuencia (Frequency): The frequency of power generation.

__Model Architecture:__  
The model used for prediction is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, which is well-suited for sequential data like time series. The architecture consists of:
- 3 LSTM layers with 128, 64, and 32 units, respectively.
- A Dense layer for output (single value prediction for active power).
- The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error loss function.

__Hyperparameter Optimization:__  
We use Optuna for hyperparameter tuning, which optimizes the following parameters:
- Learning rate (lr)
- Number of epochs
- Batch size
Optuna finds the best combination of these parameters to minimize the validation loss.
